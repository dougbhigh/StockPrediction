# Group Final_Project - Using machine learning to predict stock prices

## Background

* Stock Prices are influenced by a variety of factors, some quantifiable others random. 
The more short term the prediction the more random factors may impact results of using prediction strategy.

## Your Task
* Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
Your task is to tell a story through data visualizations. Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 

* You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library. You must use at least two of the following: 
Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, 
SQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS, Tableau

* Host application using Heroku or a tool of your choice.

* Prepare a 15-minute data deep-dive or infrastructure walkthrough that shows
machine learning in the context of what weâ€™ve already learned.

* Conclusions
	* as accurate as stock predictors may be, they will not alleviate the very human emotions of wanting to buy and sell inherent in owning stocks.
	* Factors such as timeframe, position size, volatility of the security, random nature of stocks and macro events such as the corona pandemic,
goverment trade policy or new well funded competitors to market can have outsized affect on stocks.
